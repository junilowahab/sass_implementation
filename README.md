Project: Demonstrating Version Control
For this project, I implemented version control using Git and GitHub.

I started by pushing the existing local project to a new repository on GitHub.

To follow best practices, I created a separate branch to work on additional features, instead of making changes directly to the main branch.

On this new branch, I implemented the extra features and committed the changes incrementally.

Once everything was complete and tested, I merged the feature branch back into the master branch to finalize the update.

This workflow helps keep the project history clean, organized, and easy to collaborate on.
